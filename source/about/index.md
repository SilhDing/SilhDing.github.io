<img src="google_logo.svg" alt="drawing" width="180" height="70" style="float: center; margin-top: 50px;" /> <p style="text-align: center;"> **Software Engineer Intern in Google Ads** <br> 05/2019 - 08/2019, Kirkland WA </p> 
>- Designed a new type of suggestion (to exclude low-performance audience list of line items) on advertisers’ spending to improve ads targeting performance, and completed a detailed product feature design documentation.
>- Implemented a new data aggregation dimension and modified existing data aggregation/segmentation pipeline with Google’s parallel computing framework (C++) to support new dimension and new suggestion type.
>- Developed three new algorithms (C++) that generate audience list exclusion suggestions for eligible line items, further improved these algorithms based on users’ needs and real data patterns obtained by advanced GoogleSQL query, and wrote a full set of tests to evaluate the validity and effectiveness of these algorithms.
>- ~5% line items are eligible to get suggestions (average performance improvement is 60% based on the history data), which is much better than the effectiveness of all other existing suggestion types of DV360.

>- Improved features of data classification and aggregation in the picture production monitoring system (a Python Django web app) to track statuses of picture production tasks from multiple data centers during different periods.
>-Designed some new front-end pages for more intuitive visualization (i.e., table, histogram and dynamic graphs) of vast amounts of deeply nested data, and supported one-click data export (Excel table) from web pages.
>-Wrote Dockerfile and build docker images of production monitoring application, and deployed it in QIYI App Engine (an internal container service) to achieve continuous running, automatic alarming and error reporting.
>-Developed a CI/CD system for video production application (Jenkins and GitLab) to realize the automation of production pipelines (build, integrate, test and report) triggered by GitLab events or manual operations.
