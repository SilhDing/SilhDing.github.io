## Behavior Contract


#### Operation
> The user attempts to play a tile, without a meeple.

#### Precondition
- the tile is a valid tile from the tile tower; in cannot be placed or dropped previously.

#### Postcondition

- return `true` if we can place the tile and make sure the tile is correctly placed (i.e., make sure after the placement, all adjacent edges of two tiles have the same type of feature), and make sure the position of the newly placed tile is record by the game board;
- return `false` if we cannot place the tile on the specified place (i.e., the position is occupied by other tiles or the edges of the tile cannot match the edges of its neighboring tiles if we place this tile on the specific position);
- if we can score after the placement (including scoring for city/road and monastery), at least one player would get the score;
- card would not appear from the tile tower again;
