**Test parameters**: 
The test simulates arrival rate with inter-arrival `1000` ms time with a duration `120` s, thus there are 119 clients in total. The graph above shows the number of "unhappy" clients with different number of VMs.

**Explanations**:
When the number of VMs is small, the number of unhappy clients are much larger than that of happy clients, due to the limited computation capability; increasing the number of VMs would make more clients successfully go through their requests, which is obviously shown in the graph above. The number of unhappy clients would be minimized once the number fo clients reaches to a threshold. Note that the minimal number of unhappy clients are not zero. This is because a new VM always takes some time (typically a few seconds) to boot before it may handle clients' requests, and new requests would come before the new VM is fully ready to work. Thus, several clients which send requests at the very beginning of the simulation duration would not get response before timeout, no matter how many VMs are deployed for this simulation. Based on the information from the graph, in this case, using `5` VMs for such a load would be the best.
