# 1 Introduction

### Message Switching

- Network nodes were created where several optical telegraph lines met (Paris and other sites)
- **Store-and-Forward** Operation:
    - Messages were decoded
    - Next-hop in route determined by destination address of a message
    - Each message was carried by hand to next line

### Circuit Switching

- Source first establishes a connection (circuit) to destination
- Source first establishes a connection (circuit) to destination
- The connection is explicitly **torn down** (what do you mean by tear down?)

Typically there are three phases:
1. connection set up;
2. information transfer
3. connection release

**Pros**:
- Fast and simple data transfer, once the circuit is established
- Predictable performance; E.g. guaranteed bandwidth

**Cons**:
- How about bursty traffic?
    - Do you need a permanent circuit to Facebook?
    - Circuit will be idle for significant periods of time
- How about users with different bandwidth needs?

Please note the Internet use something called **packet switching**. Please refer to Page 27 and Page 31 in slide 01.
