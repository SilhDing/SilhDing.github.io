### Random and Possibility

Shuffle a set of numbers without duplicates.

    // Init an array with set 1, 2, and 3.
    int[] nums = {1,2,3};
    Solution solution = new Solution(nums);
    
    // Shuffle the array [1,2,3] and return its result. Any permutation of [1,2,3] must equally likely to be returned.
    solution.shuffle();
    
    // Resets the array back to its original configuration [1,2,3].
    solution.reset();
    
    // Returns the random shuffling of array [1,2,3].
    solution.shuffle();
    
The key of this problem is how to make sure the possibility is even. Sometimes it is hard to figure it out but solution is super smart.

```java
class Solution {
    
    int[] nums;
    Random random;
    
    public Solution(int[] nums) {
        this.nums = nums;
        this.random = new Random();
    }
    
    /** Resets the array to its original configuration and return it. */
    public int[] reset() {
        return this.nums;
    }
    
    /** Returns a random shuffling of the array. */
    public int[] shuffle() {
        int[] res = nums.clone();
        for (int i = 0; i < res.length; i++) {
            int j = random.nextInt(i+1);
            swap(res, i, j);
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    private void swap(int[] array, int i, int j) {
        int tmp = array[i];
        array[i] = array[j];
        array[j] = tmp;
    }
}

/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Solution obj = new Solution(nums);
 * int[] param_1 = obj.reset();
 * int[] param_2 = obj.shuffle();
 */
```

How about the correctness?

Say the original array is `[1,2,3,4,5]`, and what is the probability of shuffled array `[3,4,1,5,2]`?

Let's go one by one:

1. p of `3` at index `0`? We have to make sure when `i` is 2, we get 0 from random generator, and do not get 0 after that. So p = 1/3 * 3/4 * 4/5 = 1/5;
2. p of `2` at index `1`? We have to make sure when `i` is 3, we get 1 from random generator, and do not get 1 after that. So p = 1/4 * 4/5 = 1/5;
3. ...

Then the correctness is proved.
