3 Graph VS Digraph

This is a summary between undirected graphs and directed graphs.

- **dfs and bfs algorithms**
    - Actually they share these algorithms in common.

- **connected components (CC) and strongly connected components (SCC)**
    - To implement CC for undirected graph, it is easy to do  it just with the standard dfs: A complete dfs in the constructor would find all vertices in one single connected component;
    - To implement SCC for directed graph, we have to use Kosaraju's algorithm.
    
- **Connectivity and reachability**
    - The first one is for undirected graph while the latter one is for directed graph.
    
- **Find cycles (directed or undirected cycles)**
    - Undirected graphs: while dfs, a cycle is found once `marked[v] == true`;
    - Directed graphs: while dfs, a cycle is found once `onStack[v] == true`. 
    - For directed graphs, if there is no directed cycle, then this graph is a DAG, and a topological order (sort) is available.
