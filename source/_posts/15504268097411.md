## Synchronization

How to avoid a loss of synchronization?
### Asynchronous transmission

- specifying a short maximum length for the bit sequences (so that clock doesn’t drift much within sequence)
- and resetting the clock in the beginning of each bit sequence (by using a ‘start 

For example, ASCII code: 7 bits for representing chars and 1 bit, used by **some** systems, to check parity

### Synchronous transmission

- over come the inefficiency of asynchronous transmission 
- Improves efficiency by transmitting longer sequences of bits, called packets (variable length)
- Requires extra information to indicate the end of the packet
- packet must contain clock information in addition to the data

## Encoding  

- convert a binary information sequence into a digital signal
- Encoding can be done one bit at a time or in blocks of multiple bits called a **symbol** (a symbol with 8 values means that 3 bits are sent in each time slot)
- Transmission is synchronous (a clock is used to sample the signal)
- BUT, why encoding?
    - To meets certain electrical constraints;
    - Creates control symbols, besides regular data symbols
        - E.g. start or end of frame, escape, ...
- Can do error detection or error correction
    - Some codes are illegal so receiver can detect certain classes of errors
    - Minor errors can be corrected by having multiple adjacent signals mapped to the same data symbol
- What System Requirements Must Line Codes Meet?
    - Bit timing: Transitions in signal help clock recovery
    - Transmitted power: Power consumption = $
    - Bandwidth efficiency: Excessive transitions wastes spectral 
    - Low frequency content: Some channels block low 
    - long periods of +A or of –A causes signal to “
    - Waveform should not have low-frequency 
    - Complexity/cost: Code can be implemented in electronic chip at high speed?

## Non-Return to Zero (NRZ)

But long sequences of 1’s or 0’s can cause problems

## Non-Return to Zero

- 1: make transition, 0: signal stays the same
- Solves the problem for long sequences of 1’s, but not for 0’s.

## Ethernet Manchester Encoding

- positive transition for 0, negative for 1
