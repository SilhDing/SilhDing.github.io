## Modulation

Ways to modulate a sinusoidal wave

- Amplitude Modulation (AM)
- Frequency Modulation (FM)
- Phase Modulation (PM)

Please refer to Page 5 for demonstration. Why different modulation methods: offers choices with different tradeoffs.

## binary signal

**bit rate = 1 bit/T seconds**

Please note that T is the duration of "1" or "0".

For a given communications medium:
- How do we increase the bit rate (speed) ?
- How do we achieve reliable communications?
- Are there limits to speed and reliability?

## bandwidth

**What is bandwidth?**

**Spectra and bandwidth**

## Transmission Channel Consideration

- Every medium supports transmission in a certain frequency range
- Outside this range, effects such as attenuation, .. degrade the signal too much
- Transmission and receive hardware will try to maximize the useful bandwidth in this frequency band.

## Attenuation and Dispersion

- limits to speed and distance
- Noise: “random” energy is added to the signal.
- Attenuation: some of the energy in the signal leaks away.
- Dispersion: attenuation and propagation speed are frequency dependent (change the shape of the signal).
- Effects limit the data rate that a channel can sustain; and effects becomes worse with distance.

For example, consider the pulse transmission rate

- Objective: Maximize pulse rate through a channel, that is, make T as small as possible

- If input is a narrow pulse, then typical output is a spread-out pulse with ringing
- The question is: How frequently can these pulses be transmitted without interfering with each other? **2Wc pulses/sec with binary amplitude encoding where Wc is the bandwidth of the channel** (just remember this theory)
- Bandwidth of a channel: Bandwidth Wc is range of frequencies passed by channel

## Multi-level Pulse Transmission

Assume channel of bandwidth Wc , and transmit 2W c pulses/sec (without interference) (**Nyquist theorem**)

In the absence of noise, the bit rate can be increased without limit by increasing m. **Remember how to calculate this!!!**

## Nyquist limit

![-w568](media/15489567152484/15489618387422.jpg)

**How to pass the Nyquist limit?** More aggressive encoding can increase the bandwidth, such as **modulate multi-valued symbols**, e.g., PSK+AM. But noise is the problem.

## Capacity of a noisy channel

- Arbitrarily-reliable communications is possible if the transmission rate R < C ("Arbitrarily-reliable" means the BER can be made arbitrarily small through sufficiently complex "coding")
- C can be used as a measure of how close a system design is to the best achievable performance

## Baseband VS Carrier modulation

- **Baseband modulation**: send the “bare” digital signal
    - Channel must be able to transmit low frequencies
    - For example, copper media
- **Carrier modulation**: use the signal to modulate a higher frequency signal, called a carrier
    - Can send the signal in a particular part of the spectrum
    - Can modulate the amplitude, frequency or phase
    - For example, wireless and optical

Why use carrier modulation? because of **bandpass channels**.

![-w321](media/15489567152484/15489624404142.jpg)

- Bandpass channels pass a range of frequencies around some center frequency fc.
- Digital modulators embed information into waveform with frequencies passed by bandpass channel

One example: amplitude carrier modulation
