## An interesting question

### 846. Hand of Straights

Alice has a `hand` of cards, given as an array of integers.

Now she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is size `W`, and consists of `W` consecutive cards.

Return `true` if and only if she can.

You can use map to do this problem, but here is super smart solution.

```java
public boolean isNStraightHand(int[] hand, int W) {
    // super smart
    int[] middle = new int[W];
    for (int card: hand) {
        middle[card % W]++;
    }
    int count = middle[0];
    for (int m: middle) {
        if (m != count) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

The basic idea is once we have such  a subsequence, and we divide each by `W`, we must have reminders `0, 1, ... W-1`.
