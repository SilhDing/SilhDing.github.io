### Digital networking

The first question is: **why digital signal and digital networking?**

In fact, these two can fix and match:
- Analog information can be digitized and sent over digital network
- digital networks use analog channels

**But, Why Use a Single Digital Network?**
- Economically advantageous to have a single network
- Multimedia applications want to mix different types of data
    - More convenient if a single networks is used
- Computers operate only on digital data
- Digital transmission can recover from errors (e.g. noise, distortion)
    - Not possible when transmitting analog information over an analog network (distortion, attenuation, ...). i.e., there are many problems with analog distance communications and communications becomes distance-limited
