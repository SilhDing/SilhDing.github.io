**load = avg arrival rate/avg service rate**

### latency on scale-out and scale-up

**Blue: scale out / Green: scale up**

**Why scale out is worse??**
- Blame the Load balancer (LB)
    - ignores state at each server
    - Join the shortest queue is slightly better
- Blame the architecture
    - Deciding at time of job arrival too early.
    - We need more information than current state!

**Central-Queue Architecture may help!**
- even better than scale-up
- Even harder than LB
