## What is `fetch` in Git?

See this [link](https://github.com/staticblog/wiki/wiki/%E4%BF%9D%E6%8C%81fork%E4%B9%8B%E5%90%8E%E7%9A%84%E9%A1%B9%E7%9B%AE%E5%92%8C%E4%B8%8A%E6%B8%B8%E5%90%8C%E6%AD%A5)

I encountered a problem when I work at a multi-member project. I forked a project from the leader's git repo but then I realize a highly possible situation that may occur: when I am wokring in my own repo, I may make some changes to the codes and then may commit such changes. However, simultaneouslt, it is also possible that my leader's gitlab repo would get more commits that I do not know. Whats should I do?

The solution is to set the **upstream** repo in my local git repo. Everytime when you fetech the commits from the upstream gitlab repo, in you own local git repo, you will see a new branch. Just simple merge this branch into your current working branch.

Please note that this process may also cause conflicts.
