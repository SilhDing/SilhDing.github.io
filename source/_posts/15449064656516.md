### Syntax issues

#### initialization and type conversion

One thing interesting here is:

```c++
int i = 7.8;
int i {7.8};
```
In the first case, the value of `i` would be `7` while in the second case a compile error is trigger: 

    error: floating-point to integer conversion
    
#### deduce type by initialization

```c++
auto b = true;
auto ch = 'x';
auto z = sqrt(y); // deduce the type by returns of sqrt()
```

With `auto`, we tend to use the `=` because there is no potentially troublesome type conversion involved.

#### Scope and lifetime

```cpp
vector<int> vec;  // global

struct Record {
    String name;     // member
}

void fct(int arg) { // fct is global
    // arg is local
    
    string motto {â€œwho dares wins"}; // motto is local
    
    auto p = new Record{"Hume"};  // p points to an unnamed Record
}
```

An object created by `new` lives until destroyed by `delete`.
