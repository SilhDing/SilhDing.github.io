# Latency: why distributed system is slow?

## E2E  RPC latency

First Law of Queueing Theory
- Efficiency
- Agility (user perception of quality)
- Freedom (arrival discipline: orchestrated or un-ochestrated)

**You cannot have most 2 of 3**

## latency

- **the killer, not BW**
    - more difficult to improve
    - need deep structuring changes
- Bandwidth improved through parallelism
- Impact of long latency
    - Synchronous model of RPC becomes intolerable
- What to do?
    - Trust bur verify (a.k.a. Optimistic Methods)
        - include a predicate to validate before execution
        - "When we last heard from you here was the situation"
        - "If this is still true, please do the following"
        - "If not, just tell us what happened and we will try to give you guidance"
    - cache
