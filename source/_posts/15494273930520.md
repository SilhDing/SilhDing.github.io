# 5. The Google File System

- A scalable distributed file system for large distributed data-intensive applications
- successfully met the storage requirement of Google
- what's new? its design has been driven by key observations of our application workloads and technological environment, both current and anticipated, that reflect a marked departure from some earlier file system design assumptions.
    - components are norm than the exception
    - files are huge by traditional standards
    - most files are mutated by appending new data rather than overwriting existing data.
    - co-designing the applications and the file system API beneﬁts the overall system by increasing our flexibility

## Overview

### Assumptions

See the papers.

### Interfaces

- a familiar ﬁle system interface
- usual operations to create, delete, open, close, read, and write files
- snapshot and record append operations

### Architecture

- a single master and multiple chunkservers
- Files are divided into ﬁxed-size chunks
- each chunk is replicated on multiple chunkservers.
- master maintains all ﬁle system metadata; master periodically communicates with each chunkserver in HeartBeat messages
- Clients interact with the master for metadata operations, but all data-bearing communication goes directly to the chunkservers
- cache (little benefit)

### Single Master

- Clients never read and write file data through the master; but asks which chunserver it should contact

### chunk size

- 64 MB

### Metadata
